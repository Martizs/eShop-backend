# eShop - Backend
1) Backend of an eShop website i've made in about three weeks for a few friends. Was a bit of a rushed job.
2) Uses Nodejs + Express + Passport + Mongoose + MongoDB
3) Additionally one of the projects main features is also the custom CMS setup.
4) Sadly the website has been taken down so no live prieview :(
